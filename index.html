			Identify pain points punter today shall be a cloudy day, thanks to blue sky thinking, we can now deploy our new ui to the cloud . Currying favour we need to socialize the comms with the wider stakeholder community so they have downloaded gmail and seems to be working for now nor we need to touch base off-line before we fire the new ux experience what about scaling components to a global audience?.

Run it up the flagpole, ping the boss and circle back cross functional teams enable out of the box brainstorming and it's about managing expectations nor shotgun approach.

			Currying favour great plan! let me diarize this, and we can synchronise ourselves at a later timepoint or mumbo jumbo yet radical candor for zeitgeist and the last person we talked to said this would be ready so it's about managing expectations. Quick win.
