# üèû Fast Image Zoom

Image zoom on click as seen on the popular publishing platform.

## What does it do?

You click on an image and it smoothly zooms in or out to fit the screen. You click again ‚Äî it smoothly goes back to normal. You scroll ‚Äî it also goes back.

## Why is it better than alternatives?

- üõ† Framework-agnostic ‚Äî works with everything from Knockout.js to Web Components
- üëå Zero-dependency
- üß¨ Perfect for dynamic content, mutation-agnostic ‚Äî you can do whatever you want with images, it'll work
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Blazing fast ‚Äî no matter if it's 10 images or 10000, it uses only two event listeners. Not per image, _just two listeners_. Complexity is always _O(1)_
- ü§ì Powered by quirky math to precisely calculate everything and do the trick with only _one transformation_
- ü¶ã Looks good on both dark and light modes
- üç¶ Zero-configuration by default but extensible when you need it
- üóø Works flawlessly even on iOS Safari, in every orientation, with every image no matter the size and dimensions

## Basic usage

```
npm install fast-image-zoom --save
```

or

```
yarn add fast-image-zoom
```

```JS
import imageZoom from 'fast-image-zoom'
imageZoom()
```

### Alternative ‚Äî use CDN

```HTML
<script src="https://unpkg.com/fast-image-zoom@7.0.1/dist/fast-image-zoom.js"></script>
<script>
  imageZoom()
</script>
```

That's it!

## How it works

Plugin targets _meaningful_, content images:

```HTML
<!-- yes -->
<img src="foo.jpg" alt="Cute kitten" />

<!-- no -->
<img src="bar.jpg" />
<img src="bar.jpg" alt="" />
```

## Configuration

Here are the defaults:

```JS
imageZoom({
    selector: `img[alt]:not([alt=""]):not([data-image-zoom-disabled])`,
    containerSelector: null,
    cb: () => {},
    exceed: false,
    padding: 20,
})
```

- `selector` (string) is used to target images. By default it only targets _meaningful_ images (e.g. ones with `alt`), so your icons won't be magnified on click.
- `containerSelector` limits plugin's scope to a certain element. It's useful for modals. Only the images inside that element will be clickable, and the scroll handler that un-zooms images will work on that element only.
- `cb` (function) is called after the plugin is initialized.
- `exceed` (boolean) defines whether images should exceed their natural size when zoomed. For example, if you zoom 100x100 image on a 1080p screen with `exceed: false`, its final size will be 100px, meanwhile, with `exceed: true` it will be 1080px.

- `padding` (integer) defines a gap in pixels between a zoomed image and the closest edge of the viewport.

Note that if `exceed` is false and smaller images appear to have a larger gap between their edges and the edge of the viewport, padding won't be added. For example, if you zoom a 100x100 image on a 1080p screen and your padding is set to 20, a natural gap between an image and the viewport edge would be (1080 - 100) / 2 = 490, thus there is no need to add that 20px gap.

Only pixels are supported by now.

### Setting `exceed` per image

You can explicitly define `exceed` for a specific picture via a data attribute:

```HTML
<img src="..." alt="..." data-image-zoom-exceed="true">
```

### Disabling the plugin for the specific image

You can disable zooming for any image you like, even if it has `alt`:

```HTML
<img src="..." alt="..." data-image-zoom-disabled>
```

Note that if you redefine the `selector` in a way that doesn't account `data-image-zoom-disabled` attribute, this feature will stop working.

### Restyling

You can always hack the plugin redefining straightforward CSS:

#### Changing a timing function

```CSS
.image-zoom,
.image-zoom-wrapper::after {
    transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```

#### Changing the background color

```CSS
.image-zoom-wrapper::after {
    background-color: hotpink;
}
```

For now, `!important` might be needed, as styles are injected into `<head>`. This will probably be changed in the future.

## Anatomy

- `.image-zoom-wrapper` ‚Äî element that wraps every image. Mimics its `display` property. We use it to add page background and slightly separate the zoomed image from what's behind it.
- `.image-zoom-wrapper-zoomed` ‚Äî the same wrapper but for when the image is zoomed.
- `.image-zoom` ‚Äî the image itself that was processed and is interactive, ready to zoom.
- `.image-zoom-zoomed` ‚Äî zoomed image.

## Disabling the plugin

Being called, the plugin returns the destroy function that you may call to remove event listeners. It will also remove related styles from `<head>` and from the images themselves.

```JS
const destroy = imageZoom()

// don't need it anymore
destroy()
```

## Limitations

- `img` inline styles will be overwritten. Use CSS selectors to stylize images.
- `img` shouldn't have transforms. If needed, wrap it with a container and apply transforms there instead.
- Container's `overflow-x` will be `hidden`. If `containerSelector` is null, then `overflow-x` will be `hidden` for the root element.

Enjoy!

The old URL (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mvoloskov/fast-image-zoom/dist/fast-image-zoom.min.js) is deprecated. Please use the new, versioned one: https://unpkg.com/fast-image-zoom@7.0.0/dist/fast-image-zoom.js.

To migrate, just replace this

```HTML
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mvoloskov/fast-image-zoom/dist/fast-image-zoom.min.js"></script>
```

...with this:

```HTML
<script src="https://unpkg.com/fast-image-zoom@7.0.1/dist/fast-image-zoom.js"></script>
```

The old URL was a historic mistake. I apologize for the inconvenience.
